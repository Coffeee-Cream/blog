My thoughts always wondered about myths .

i mean like i read a lot of history articles and learning about it.
and i always wonder ...
is it a story or a lie?

well by researches i know that it is a tale a lie and a story.

but i know some can be called a myth and is a myth , and some are called myths and end up being rumours and becomes a world conflict  and fight saying "your story is not real . mine is!"
and so on.
